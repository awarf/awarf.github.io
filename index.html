<h1>Hello World! This is Ally's Page! Check Check</h1>


<p>Hi honey</p>

<p>In addition to working with persons with disabilities, I like to work in Dr. Lane and Dr. Larson's labs at Illinois
Institute of Technology. I work on a lot of Medical Human Factors projects where I help fit assistive technology and medical
equipment to the needs of the person. I enjoy working with a team of researchers to work toward the goal of building better
medical devices for people.</p>
	
<p>In the future, I hope to study Human Factors Engineering. Human Factors Engineering is actually quite important though
few people have heard about it. Human Factors is about making human systems more efficient, safe and error-free.  
Anywhere there is a person using a system or machine human factors principles apply. I desire to work in safety to make
systems safe for people to use. I'm currently in the process of applying for PhD programs in Human Factors Engineering. I have 
seen a lot of good programs, I'm looking through them carefully to see what programs best fit my goals. Its exciting to be at 
this point in my academics where I start looking at research efforts to be a part of! I look forward to building new products 
with the 'person' in mind. Human Factors is about including the human experience in each piece of technology and system.</p>

<p>Besides my current course of study, I also enjoy life with my beagle named Dixie! I rescued my beagle when she was about 
6 months old and she has brought much happiness to my life! On the weekend I like to take her out to do agility. I don't do 
agility to compete with Dixie, but do it because she enjoys it! With beagles being a hunting breed they need lots of exercise!
Dixie enjoys the rigorous exercise and learning of new commands that agility brings. Other than her agility Dixie also 
requires a two mile run everyday to keep her energy level down. But, I enjoy running her down a trail near my home every morning
because it gives us both the cardio exercise that we need!</p>

<p>I hope you find some useful or just interesting information on my page. If nothing else I hope to give you a glimpse of my
passions, ambitions, and goals as you look through my page! Thomas Edison stated 'I never perfected an invention that I did not think
about in terms of the service it might give others...I find out what the world needs then I proceed to invent'. Seeing a world of 
human need, I envision possibilities to create optimal human experiences.</p>
