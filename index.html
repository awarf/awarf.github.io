            <p> Hi I'm Ally! Currently, I'm a student at Illinois Institute of Technology studying Rehabilitation Counseling Science.
I enjoy working with a diverse group of people every day! I work to help individuals with disabilities obtain employment and
find self-fulfilling careers. Often this involves finding a piece of assistive technology to help the person fulfil their
dreams. I enjoy helping people find the right person-technology fit to best suit the person's individual needs.</p>

<p> In addition to working with persons with disabilities, I like to work in Dr. Lane and Dr. Larson's labs at Illinois 
Institute of Technology. I work on a lot of Medical Human Factors projects where I help fit assistive technology and medical
equipment to the needs of the person. I enjoy working with a team of researchers to work toward the goal of building better 
medical devices for people. </p>

<p> Though not widely recognized these labs type of labs are practically the definition of Human Factor engineering and 
ergonomics. According  The Dictionary for Human Factors/Ergonomics by James H. Stramler (Boca Raton, LA: CRC Press, 1993) 
"Human Factors is that field which is involved in conducting research regarding human psychological, social, physical, and 
biological characteristics, maintaining the information obtained from that research, and working to APPLY that information 
with respect to the design, operation, or use of products or systems for optimizing human performance, health, safety, 
and/or habitability". Essentially Human Factors is designing technology to meet the needs of people and designing that 
technology to interact with these people seamlessly in their daily lives. For more information on human factors please 
visit the follow site.
